%\section{Closed Under Intersection}
\section{Amplification of $\bp$ to $\strongbp$}

The aim of this section is to prove the following amplification result:

\begin{theorem}\label{amplify}
Let $C$ be a \emph{$\{\Sigma,\Pi,\bp,\parity\}$}-constructible complexity class. Then \emph{$\bp \cdot C = \strongbp \cdot C$}.
\end{theorem}
In order to prove this result, we will use the concept of a majority reduction.
\begin{definition}\label{defmajority}\emph{
We say that a complexity class $C$ is \emph{closed under majority reductions} if for any language $L$, the language $\majority(L) = \{(x_1,...,x_k) : k \in \mathbb{N}, |\{x_i : x_i \in L\}| \ge k/2\}$ is in $C$.
}\end{definition}
Now, we have the following lemma:
\begin{lemma}\label{majorityimpliesamplify}
If $C$ is a complexity class which is closed under majority reductions, then\linebreak \emph{$\bp \cdot C = \strongbp \cdot C$.}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof} \end{proof}
Thus, in order to prove Theorem \ref{amplify}, we just need to show that any \emph{$\{\Sigma,\Pi,\bp,\parity\}$}-constructible complexity class is closed under majority reductions. In order to show that these are closed under majority reductions, we will need the help of another property:
\begin{definition}\label{defintersection}\emph{
We say that a class $C$ is \emph{closed under intersection} if for any language $L \in C$, the language $\intersection(L) = \{(x_1,...,x_k) : k\in\mathbb{N}, x_i \in L_i ~ \forall i\}$ is in $C$.
}\end{definition}
We will demonstrate that all $\{\Sigma, \Pi, \bp, \parity\}$-constructible complexity classes are closed under intersection and under majority reductions. To do this, we will use induction on the number of operators in $C$. Clearly $\p$ is closed under intersection and majority reductions. Thus, the result follows from the following two lemmas:

\begin{lemma}\label{intersectionlemma}
Let $C$ be a \emph{$\{\Sigma,\Pi,\bp,\parity\}$}-constructible complexity class. If $C$ is closed under majority reductions and under intersection, then (i) \emph{$\Sigma \cdot C$}, (ii) \emph{$\Pi \cdot C$}, (iii) \emph{$\bp \cdot C$}, and (iv) \emph{$\parity \cdot C$} are all closed under intersection.
%Let $C$ be a \emph{$\{\Sigma,\Pi,\bp,\parity\}$}-constructible complexity class. Then $C$ is closed under intersection.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}\label{amplifymainlemma}
Let $C$ be a \emph{$\{\Sigma,\Pi,\bp,\parity\}$}-constructible complexity class. If $C$ is closed under majority reductions, then (i) \emph{$\Sigma \cdot C$}, (ii) \emph{$\Pi \cdot C$}, (iii) \emph{$\bp \cdot C$}, and (iv) \emph{$\parity \cdot C$} are all closed under majority reductions.
\end{lemma}
We begin with the proof of Lemma \ref{intersectionlemma}
\begin{proof} \emph{(Lemma \ref{intersectionlemma})}

Suppose $L \in \Sigma\cdot C$. Then there exists a $C$ machine $M$ such that $x \in L_1$ if and only if there exists some $y$ (of length polynomial in the length of $x$) such that $M$ accepts $(x, y)$. Now, we want to construct a $\Sigma \cdot C$ machine for $\intersect(L)$; that is, given a $k$-tuple $(x_1,x_2,...,x_k)$, we want to determine if all $x_i$ are in $L$. To do this, we just guess a $k$-tuple $(y_1,y_2,...,y_k)$, and then check if $M$ accepts $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, ..., and $(x_k, y_k)$. This is equivalent to checking that $((x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2),...,(x_k,y_k)) \in \intersect(M)$, and by assumption, $\intersect(M)$ is in $C$ since $M$ is in $C$.

The proof for $\Pi \cdot C$ is analogous to the proof for $\Sigma \cdot C$.

Now we consider $\bp \cdot C$. By assumption, $C$ is closed under majority reductions, so by Lemma \ref{majorityimpliesamplify}, $\bp \cdot C = \strongbp \cdot C$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof} \emph{(Lemma \ref{amplifymainlemma})}

We consider (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) separately. Part (iv) is the most difficult, and will not be finished until Section \ref{oracle}.
\end{proof}

\section{An Oracle Result}\label{oracle}

To complete the proof of Lemma \ref{amplifymainlemma} (b-iv), we use the following generalization of a result in \cite{Toda}, which shows that $\parity \cdot (\p ^{\parity\cdot\p}) = \parity\cdot\p$, a fact which is used to show that $\parity \cdot \p$ is closed under majority reductions.

\begin{theorem}\label{oracleparityc}
Let $C$ be a class containing \emph{$\p$} which is closed under intersection. Then\linebreak \emph{$\parity \cdot (\p^{\parity \cdot C}) = \parity \cdot C$}.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
The direction $\parity \cdot C \subseteq \parity \cdot (\p^{\parity \cdot C})$ is trivial. Let us consider the interesting direction\linebreak $\parity \cdot (\p^{\parity \cdot C})\subseteq \parity\cdot C$.
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}\emph{
While this paper applies Theorem \ref{oracle} only in the case where $C$ is $\{\Sigma,\Pi,\bp,\parity\}$-constructible, it can also be used to show, for instance, that $\parity \cdot (\p^{\parity \cdot \pp}) = \parity \cdot \pp$, although it is nontrivial to show that $\pp$ is closed under intersection. For a proof, see \cite{Beigel}.
}\end{remark}
